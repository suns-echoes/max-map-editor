				<h2>First working preview release!</h2>
				<p>
					Welcome back M.A.X. Commanders!
				</p>
				<p>
					Today is big day! After a few days of hard work, the first working preview release is ready.
				</p>
				<p>
					This release contains the setup screen where M.A.X. game path must be provided.
					After the setup, the map editor will load the sample map and display it.
					This presentation shows the map drawn using the new tile system and layers.
					It is possible to pan and zoom the map.
					Some debug information are displayed in the background.
				</p>
				<p>
					The "utility" is now available for download here: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/suns-echoes/max-game-map-editor/releases/tag/app-v0.1.11">the "utility v0.1.11" release!</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					May the new 2k25 year bring many good and won to the M.A.X. battles to all of us!

				<h2>Tauri v2</h2>
				<p>
					Migration to Tauri v2 is now complete.
					With the new version more desired technologies are available.
				</p>
				<h2>WebGL 2</h2>
				<p>
					Rendering system has been upgraded to WebGL 2.
					Though it is still not WebGPU, it is large step forward.
				</p>
				<h2>Rendering</h2>
				<p>
					Current map rendering now supports displaying multiple terrain layers,
					and the tile flipping and rotation mechanism is complete.
					The tile transformation is applied accordingly to cell data specified in the map.
				</p>
				<p>
					The map's zoom feature enables smooth transitions between 2x magnification and a full map view.
					The zoom point is now centered on the display but will be aligned with the pointer position in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					The panning is aligned with the pointer's movement and is preserved when zooming.
				</p>
				<p>
					The implementation of a multi-layer map rendering is in progress.
					Layering will allow the transparent tiles, like the shore, to be placed above water.
					The layering and transparency will provide better results and more flexibility
					than using shores with integrated water patterns.

					After a long break, the "utility" is back with a new update.
				</p>
				<h2>Security</h2>
				<p>
					The new security measures have been implemented to ensure that
					JavaScript code is not able to access arbitrary files on the
					user's filesystem.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="log-bg log-message">
				<h2>New tile system</h2>
				<p>
					The new tile system was developed to allow more flexibility
					in the map creation process.
				</p>
				<p>
					The new system allows the user to rotate and flip the tiles.
					Also, the new tile system provides matching data for
					the auto-shore feature and random map generator.
				</p>
				<p>
					The shore tiles have masked out water (except shore waves)
					which will allow correct rendering for any transformation
					of shore tiles and underlaying water tiles.

				<p>
					The editor will be extensible with asset packs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The asset packs will contain new tile sets and palettes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The map project file will contain references to the used asset packs.
					As an option it will be possible to save map project with
					embedded asset packs.

					The "utility" is being transferred to the Tauri App

					This update comes with the <b>v0 release</b> that will be

					The rendering process transition is in progress. Switching
					from canvas rendering to WebGL 1.
				</p>
				<p>
					This update will also ensure a smoother mapping experience
					on weaker machines, even with caustic animations enabled!
					Also, less CPU power will be required to redraw the map,
					for only one texture will be rendered using GPU.
					That should ease the power consumption, so we won't need
					the power station farm to power the whole process
					of materializing our creativity.

				<p>
					One day, a new M.A.X. Commander was assigned to explore
					distant star systems to find new habitable worlds.
					The worlds that no one had seen but many dreamed about.
					The Commander decided to utilize all means necessary
					to complete the task.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, careful planning and gathering all available data
					about the known universe led to only one conclusion:
					it is very doubtful to find new compatible worlds using
					conventional methods. Determined, the Commander devised
					the ultimate plan.
				</p>
				<p>
					The plan was to create a highly sophisticated "utility"
					capable of distorting the fabric of space and time,
					which would then be used to develop new habitable planets.
